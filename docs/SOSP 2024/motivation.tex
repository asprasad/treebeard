\section{Motivation}

Our main aim while designing \Treebeard{} was to unify the diverse set of implementation
strategies that have been used in existing systems for decision tree inference. Some 
differences in these systems are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decision tree inference is run on several platforms including CPUs and GPUs. The 
  implementations used on each of these platforms are different and the techniques used
  to optimize them are also different.
  \item A diverse set techniques have been proposed for optimization of decision tree 
  inference on CPUs and GPUs \cite{VPred, Tahoe, Treelite, XGBoost, Hummingbird, QuickScorer, FIL}. 
  No system exists that unifies the disparate optimizations implemented in these systems.
  \item A very extensive design space of optimizations exists for decision tree inference
  outside the few that have been proposed in the literature. However, currently no 
  system exists that is capable of exploring this space and identifying the best set 
  of parameters to use for a given model and platform.
  \item Different systems use different in-memory representations for the model. For example,
  XGBoost uses a sparse representation, RAPIDs FIL uses what is called the reorg representation 
  and Tahoe uses a variation of the reorg representation. Currently, systems implement 
  inference kernels that are tied to a single representation of the model. Again, this means
  that no current system can explore different combinations of in-memory representations 
  and optimizations.
\end{itemize}
At high-level, to make \Treebeard{} capable of unifying these differences, we design 1)  
expressive intermediate representations that can represent and compose several proposed 
optimizations 2) a scheduling language that specifies the structure of the
generated code and 3) a plugin mechanism with which different in-memory representations
can be composed with different optimizations. Finally, we develop a heuristic to
explore the extensive optimization space that \Treebeard{}'s design enables.
